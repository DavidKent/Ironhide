Ironhide is a plugin for a framework called Quasar, I made this a plugin rather than making it a part of the framework
because the framework shouldn't force Mongodb or Redis. This is more of an example on how to hook into Quasar's 
app route handling and execute a security check before allowing a client to view the requested page. 

This is route specific meaning that files not pertaining to the route will not recieve security protection.
